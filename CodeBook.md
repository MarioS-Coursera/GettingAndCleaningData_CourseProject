# Codebook

Original Data from the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0**
This Codebook will only describe the steps performed to gain the two dataset according to the course project.
For more information about the original dataset and its data please consult the Readme.txt file inside the main folder of the dataset or contact activityrecognition@smartlab.ws

## Script
The script *run_analysis.R* will perform all actions for transforming the original data into the two datasets.

## Datasets
The two datasets generated by this script are a subsets of the merged training and test data of the original dataset.

Both datasets contain the mean and standard deviation data
* mean(): Mean value
* std(): Standard deviation
* meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency  

of the following signals
* tBodyAcc-XYZ
* tGravityAcc-XYZ
* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* tBodyGyro-XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc-XYZ
* fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* fBodyGyro-XYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag

For more information about this data please read the *feature _info.txt* file in the original dataset.

## Combined Dataset
Besides the mean and standard deviation information this dataset contains following information
* *label*       - Class of activity performed during this meassurement
* *subject*     - id of the subject performing the activity of this meassurement
Each row denotes a single meassurement of the feature data

The data is stored in the object *combinedDataset*

## Tidy Dataset
Besides the mean and standard deviation information this dataset contains following information
* *subject*     - id of the subject performing the activity of this meassurement
* *activity*    - Class of activity performed during this meassurement

Each row contains the mean of the data for each linear combination of subject and activity.
This means every row holds an average of all meassurements from each feature for a specific activity of an individual subject.

The data is stored in the object *tidyDataset* and the file *tidy_dataset.csv* in the workspace
